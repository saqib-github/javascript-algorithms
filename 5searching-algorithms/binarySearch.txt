// Binary search algorithm
* Binary search is a much faster form of search algorithm
* Rather than eliminate one element at a time, 
 you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time
 * Binary search is only works on sorted arrays.

 > Big O of binary search algorithm
 best case: O(1)
 worst and average case: O(log n);
