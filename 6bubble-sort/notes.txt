* what is sortings?
>> Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array)
>> so that the items are in some kind of order
* Examples
. Sorting numbers from smallest to largest
. Sorting numbers alphabetically
. Sorting movies based on the release year
. sorting movies based on the revenue
. sorting numbers/strigs based on the different conditions
* Why do we need to learn this ?
>> Sorting is an incredibly common task, so its good to know how it works.
>> there are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have
their own advantages and disadvantages.
// JavaScript has a sort method
["steele", "colt", "datastructures", "algorithms"].sort()
["algorithms", "colt", "datastruct", "steele"]
[6,4,15,10].sort()
[10, 15, 4,6]

* tell javascript to how to sort things
>> the built-in method accepts an optional computator function
>> you can use this computator function to tell javascript how you want it to sort things
>> the computator looks at pairs of elements (a and b),
 > if it returns a negative number, a should come before b,
 > if it returns a positive number, a should come after b,
 > if it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as sort is concerned

best case: O(n)
worst case: O(n^2)
