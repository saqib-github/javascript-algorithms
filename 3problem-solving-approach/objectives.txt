* define what an algorithm is to be used.
* devise a plan to solve algorithm.
* compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problem 
  and divide and conquer.

Notes:
  what is an algorithm ? 
  ans: a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.
  why you need to know this process ?
  ans: almost everything that you do in programming involoves some kind of algorithms.
  It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer.
  
  Problem solving
  > Understand the problem
  > explore concrete examples
  > break it down 
  > solve/simplify the problem
  > look back and refactor the problem
  Understand the problem: 
  1. can i restate the problem in my own words ?
  2. what are the inputs that go into the problem ?
  3. what are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
  4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? in other words, do i have enough information to solve the problem?
  5. how should i label the important pieces of data are a part of the problem?
